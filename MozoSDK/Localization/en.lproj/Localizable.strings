"faq_retailer_17_answer" = "PIN stands for Personal Identification Number. A PIN is similar to a password in that both try to ensure that the person seeking access is the person who is authorized to gain access.<br/>
In Mozo, a password is used to protect your account (phone number when you login to system). A PIN is used to protected your wallet. You will always be asked for your PIN before transferring Mozo.";
